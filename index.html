        <h1>Kakashi Hatake</h1>
        <p> <em>Badass Warrior and <strong>Lover of Cyrus</strong>.</em></p>
        <p>Kakashi graduated from the Ninja Academy and became a Genin, when he was merely 5 years old, then at 6 years old, became a Chuunin. He later became a Jounin and a member of the AnBu Assasination squad for Hidden Leaf Village. We see him as
          he
          takes up the role as being a sensei for the new Chunnins. Kakashi values team work very much and believes in a battle, your first responbility is to guarantee the safety of your companions. Oh, and he has a Sharingan eye which can copy any
          ninja
          skills he sees, but since the Sharingan pupil are usually in both eyes, it's rumoured that Kakashi's sharingan was put into him through surgery.</p>
